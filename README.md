### p5js-typescript-boilerplate

Clone this repo and then run

```
npm install
```

---

When adding multiple typescript files, simply use `import` to import the modules to link. You _do not_ need `<script>` tag to link!

To run the developent server run

```
npm run dev
```

To build the project run

```
npm run build
```

Building the project will create a `dist` folder containing `index.html` and necessary `javascript` files.

This project uses [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) under the hood to link everything together
